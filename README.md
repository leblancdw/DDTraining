# Introduction to Infrastructure as Code
This short training will provide the learner with a high-level overview of Infrastructure as Code (IaC). A brief history of what IaC is
and why it's important is presented, along with some key concepts and tools related to IaC. The concepts covered are applied in the
accompanying lab, employing **Terraform** as an IaC tool within **Google Cloud Platform** as the development environment.

Due to its short nature, this training only scratches the surface of the topics covered. A lengthier training or series of trainings
would allow for the building out of the topics covered, and also would include additional formative assessment activities in the
experience.
